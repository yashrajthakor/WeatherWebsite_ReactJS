## Introduction

Building a Weather app with JavaScript is an excellent project for beginners. It helps to understand the core basics of the DOM and teaches how to use fetch API, to call and get data from a third-party service.

In this tutorial, we'll be building a geolocation-based weather app that will show us the current weather data depending on the user's location.

By building this app, we'll learn some stuff like,
* Interacting with the DOM
* The use of Fetch API
* The navigator object of JavaScript
* How to use a third-party API service and more

Here, Getting Data from API
To get the data, we are dependent on a third-party service. We will use a website called OpenWeatherMap. OpenWeatherMap is a service that provides various weather data through API. We can integrate the API into our app and can use the data on our website. An API is like a waiter, it works as a medium between the server and the client to serve the data to the client according to the client's request.

OpenWeatherMap is free up to a certain number of requests. After that, it charges money. To use the API, we need an API key.
